# Price-Prediction-using-ML
The project "Old Vehicle Price Prediction" focuses on leveraging supervised machine learning regression algorithm to forecast the prices of used cars.
In an era marked by increasing interest in the resale market for vehicles, accurate pricing is paramount for both buyers and sellers.
This project addresses the need for a reliable, data-driven solution to estimate the value of pre-owned vehicles. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the datasets,revealing valuable patterns and relationship among various vehicle attributes. This aided in making informed decisions during feature selection and model development. 
Multiple regression algorithms were assessed, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression. 
This project's significance lies in its ability to enhance transparency and efficiency in the pre-owned vehicle market,empowering both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions based on accurate price predictions. 
As the demand for reliable resale valuations continues to grow, this project serves as a valuable tool for facilitating fair and data-driven transactions in the old vehicle market
